# a new system of feedback
## introduction
---
With the introduction of a custom solution to feedback management in NLK, a new system can be put in place to further maximise the efficiency of tracking the progress of various aspects of the ministry.

## outline

### issue tracking

This new proposed model will use an "issue raising" approach to criticism, where once an issue is raised, it will persist in the system and its progress will be tracked over the weeks. this may be done in several ways, but an example is for a rating to be given to the specific issue for each week.
this minimises the repitition of similar comments and instead, a single issue can be tracked across a span of time.
### encouragement collection
the positive feedback system will remain relatively the same, where specific praise points can be added to a pool of encouragement :D.

## technical considerations
---
this approach also reduces the design complexity involved with creating the application as opposed to the traditional system. this is because the traditional system involves many repeating comments who all share the same "issue", which is a layer of complexity that can be avoided using the new system.
