# Introduction

## Purpose

nlkhub aims to provide a solution for adding and tracking feedback given across different sunday services at New Life Kids. Apart from its basic functionality, nlkhub should have an intuitive and simple interface, to minimise usability bottlenecks and inefficient feedback production. More advanced functionalities are also within the scope of this project, for the purpose of minimising manual efforts in organisation, tracking and searching tasks.
